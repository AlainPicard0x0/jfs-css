# Website Styling Exercise

* **Objective** - To add CSS to a Website.
* **Purpose** - To practice using CSS with HTML.
* **Description**
    * You are provided with an `index.html` document at the root of this project, and a `style.css` in the `css` folder.
    * You will add CSS to the style.css file.
    * You will have atleast 1 hour to work on this now, and can complete it on your own time if need be.
    * Use the skills learned in the HTML and CSS lessons to complete this project.
    * "Ask three before me"
        * We are here to help, but please check web resources or consult with peers prior to asking Instructor/TAs. This helps build your "search muscles" which are very important to your future roles as Developers.
    * The objective is to style the website with comparable quality to the image below.
